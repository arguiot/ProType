			What is ProType?
		</h1>
		<p>
			ProType is JavaScript front end (browser) framework. It is object oriented only and help you separate tasks and views while staying productive.

	<section class="why">
		<h1>
			Why ProType?
		</h1>
		<p>
			Because I couldn't find a framework that could use classes in the most effective way. I wanted something that could resemble other language, such as Swift (and Cocoa) or Dart (with Flutter). ProType will help you build big UIs, such as web apps or apps
			with other frameworks like Cordova or Electron.
